### Study

Predicting the success of NFL Quarterbacks, with emphasis on college performance, pre-draft rankings, and team investment in money and draft capital.

### Data

nfl_merged.ipynb / nfl_merged.csv includes data from ..\Data_Artifacts\pro_ref_individ.csv and \Data_Artifacts\nfl_career_statistics.csv;

created \Data_Artifacts_csv_inspector.ipynb for use in comparing and combining similar columns'

##### Target/y Data

The ultimate goal will be to determine which of those target/y are indicative of overall quarterback success (or can be investigated on their own) using the feature/X data from college football data.

Target/y columns:

* **hof:** Hall of Fame induction
* **wins_succ:** win % > XX, 1 or more Superbowl wins),
* **award_succ:** Awards (Pro Bowl > 1, All Pro > 1)
* **stat_succ:** Statistical Success (passing_yards > 15,000, touchdown_passes > 50....)
* **earn_succ:** Earnings Success (career_earnings > $5M
* **long_succ:** Longevity success (years_played > 5 years)
* **nfl_agg_succ:** aggregate NFL success, based on combination of the aforementioned success targets.
  * eg.: nfl_agg_succ = 1 for any player with 1 in >= 2 or more of the other columns (stat_succ =1 and wins_succ = 1).

All columns will be binary (1, 0), ready-to-use as a target/y.  We will begin with NFL Aggregate Sucess target as well as perform branched/multi-prediction Neural Network models for multiple target/y columns.

##### Feature/X Data

To gather X features, we will gather the following data for college Quarterback prospects entering the NFL:
